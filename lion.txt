The African Lion (Panthera leo)

Habitat:
Lions primarily inhabit African savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands. They can also be found in some parts of Asia, though in much smaller numbers.

Characteristics:
- Adult males weigh 150-250 kg and feature distinctive manes
- Females weigh 120-180 kg and are the primary hunters
- Known for their powerful roar that can be heard up to 5 miles away
- Live in social groups called prides
- Excellent night vision and powerful muscles for hunting

King of the Jungle:
Despite being called the "King of the Jungle," lions actually prefer open grasslands and savannas. This title comes from their position as apex predators and their majestic appearance. They have no natural predators in their habitat and are considered one of the most powerful big cats.
