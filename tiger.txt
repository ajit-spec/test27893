Tigers are the largest living cat species and can reach up to 3.3 meters in length.
Each tiger has a unique pattern of stripes, much like human fingerprints.
Tigers can bring down prey up to five times their own body weight and can leap up to 6 meters in length.
Tigers are endangered, with only about 3,900 wild tigers remaining in the world as of 2021.
A tiger's roar can be heard from up to 3 kilometers away and can paralyze their prey with fear.
Unlike most cats, tigers are excellent swimmers and can swim up to 6 kilometers at a stretch.
A tiger's night vision is six times better than humans, making them incredibly efficient nocturnal hunters.
